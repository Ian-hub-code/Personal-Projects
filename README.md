# Pricing Panel Project

A pricing panel that I created with the use of HTML and CSS, this learned me new things like:
- using a google font
- flexbox to rearrange elements in column form and to distribute left over space dynamically
- making use of the last-child function 
- using transitions to make a buttons look good
- add hover and focus functions to buttons
- using @media to accommadate smaller and larger devices viewing the panel
