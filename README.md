# Pricing Panel Project
Some projects I have worked on

A pricing panel that I created with the use of HTML and CSS, this learned me new things like:
- using a google font
- flexbox
- making use of the last-child function
- using transitions to make a buttons look good
- add hover and focus functions to buttons
- using @media to accomadate smaller and larger devices viewing the panel
